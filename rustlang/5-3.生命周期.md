# 生命周期

借出一个其它人所有资源的引用可以是很复杂的。例如，想象一下下列操作：

* 我获取了一个某种资源的句柄
* 我借给你了一个关于这个资源的引用
* 我决定不再需要这个资源了，然后释放了它，这时你仍然持有它的引用
* 你决定使用这个资源

噢！你的引用指向一个无效的资源。这叫做*悬垂指针*（*dangling pointer*）或者“释放后使用”，如果这个资源是内存的话。

要修正这个问题的话，我们必须确保第四步永远也不在第三步之后发生。Rust 所有权系统通过一个叫*生命周期*（*lifetime*）的概念来做到这一点，它定义了一个引用有效的作用域。

当我们有一个获取引用作为参数的函数，我们可以隐式或显式涉及到引用的生命周期：

```rust
// implicit
fn foo(x: &i32) {
}

// explicit
fn bar<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
}
```

`'a`读作“生命周期 a”。技术上讲，每一个引用都有一些与之相关的生命周期，不过编译器在通常情况让你可以省略（也就是，省略，查看下面的[生命周期省略](#生命周期省略（lifetime-elision）)）它们。在我们讲到它之前，让我们拆开显式的例子看看：

```rust
fn bar<'a>(...)
```

之前我们讨论了一些[函数语法](Functions 函数.md)，不过我们并没有讨论函数名后面的`<>`。一个函数可以在`<>`之间有“泛型参数”，生命周期也是其中一种。我们在[本书的后面](Generics 泛型.md)讨论其他类型的泛型。不过现在让我们着重看生命周期。

我们用`<>`声明了生命周期。这是说`bar`有一个生命周期`'a`。如果我们有两个引用参数，它应该看起来像这样：

```rust
fn bar<'a, 'b>(...)
```

接着在我们的参数列表中，我们使用了我们命名的生命周期：

```rust
...(x: &'a i32)
```

如果我们想要一个`&mut`引用，我们这么做：

```rust
...(x: &'a mut i32)
```

如果你对比一下`&mut i32`和`&'a mut i32`，他们是一样的，只是后者在`&`和`mut i32`之间夹了一个`'a`生命周期。`&mut i32`读作“一个`i32`的可变引用”，而`&'a mut i32`读作“一个带有生命周期'a的i32的可变引用”。

## 在`struct`中

当你处理[结构体](5.12.Structs 结构体.md)时你也需要显式的生命周期：

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let y = &5; // this is the same as `let _y = 5; let y = &_y;`
    let f = Foo { x: y };

    println!("{}", f.x);
}
```

如你所见，`struct`也可以有生命周期。跟函数类似的方法，

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
# x: &'a i32,
# }
```

声明一个生命周期，接着

```rust
# struct Foo<'a> {
x: &'a i32,
# }
```

使用它。然而为什么这里我们需要一个生命周期呢？因为我们需要确保任何`Foo`的引用不能比它包含的`i32`的引用活的更久。

## `impl`块

让我们在`Foo`中实现一个方法：

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    fn x(&self) -> &'a i32 { self.x }
}

fn main() {
    let y = &5; // this is the same as `let _y = 5; let y = &_y;`
    let f = Foo { x: y };

    println!("x is: {}", f.x());
}
```

如你所见，我们需要在`impl`行为`Foo`声明一个生命周期。我们重复了`'a`两次，就像在函数中：`impl<'a>`定义了一个生命周期`'a`，而`Foo<'a>`使用它。

## 多个声明周期

如果你有多个引用，你可以多次使用同一个生命周期：

```rust
fn x_or_y<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
#    x
# }
```

这意味着`x`和`y`存活在同样的作用域内，并且返回值也同样存活在这个作用域内。如果你想要`x`和`y`有不同的生命周期，你可以使用多个生命周期参数：

```rust
fn x_or_y<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &'a str {
#    x
# }
```

在这个例子中，`x`和`y`有不同的有效的作用域，不过返回值和`x`有相同的生命周期

## 理解作用域（Thinking in scopes）
理解生命周期的一个办法是想象一个引用有效的作用域。例如：

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = &5;     // -+ y goes into scope
                    //  |
    // stuff        //  |
                    //  |
}                   // -+ y goes out of scope
```

加入我们的`Foo`：

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let y = &5;           // -+ y goes into scope
    let f = Foo { x: y }; // -+ f goes into scope
    // stuff              //  |
                          //  |
}                         // -+ f and y go out of scope
```

我们的`f`生存在`y`的作用域之中，所以一切正常。那么如果不是呢？下面的代码不能工作：

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let x;                    // -+ x goes into scope
                              //  |
    {                         //  |
        let y = &5;           // ---+ y goes into scope
        let f = Foo { x: y }; // ---+ f goes into scope
        x = &f.x;             //  | | error here
    }                         // ---+ f and y go out of scope
                              //  |
    println!("{}", x);        //  |
}                             // -+ x goes out of scope
```

噢！就像你在这里看到的一样，`f`和`y`的作用域小于`x`的作用域。不过当我们尝试`x = &f.x`时，我们让`x`引用一些将要离开作用域的变量。

命名作用域用来赋予作用域一个名字。有了名字是我们可以谈论它的第一步。

## 'static
叫做`static`的作用域是特殊的。它代表某样东西具有横跨整个程序的生命周期。大部分 Rust 程序员当他们处理字符串时第一次遇到`'static`：

```rust
let x: &'static str = "Hello, world.";
```

基本字符串是`&'static str`类型的因为它的引用一直有效：它们被写入了最终库文件的数据段。另一个例子是全局量：

```rust
static FOO: i32 = 5;
let x: &'static i32 = &FOO;
```

它在二进制文件的数据段中保存了一个`i32`，而`x`是它的一个引用。

## 生命周期省略（Lifetime Elision）
Rust支持强大的在函数体中的局部类型推断，不过这在项签名中是禁止的以便允许只通过项签名本身推导出类型。然而，出于人体工程学方面的考虑，有第二个非常限制的叫做“生命周期省略”的推断算法适用于函数签名。它只基于签名部分自身推断而不涉及函数体，只推断生命周期参数，并且只基于 3 个易于记忆和无歧义的规则，虽然并不隐藏它涉及到的实际类型，因为局部推断可能会适用于它。

当我们讨论生命周期省略的时候，我们使用*输入生命周期和输出生命周期*（*input lifetime and output lifetime.*）。*输入生命周期*是关于函数参数的，而*输出生命周期*是关于函数返回值的。例如，这个函数有一个输入生命周期：

```rust
fn foo<'a>(bar: &'a str)
```

这个有一个输出生命周期：

```rust
fn foo<'a>() -> &'a str
```

这个两者皆有：

```rust
fn foo<'a>(bar: &'a str) -> &'a str
```

In order to make common patterns more ergonomic, Rust allows lifetimes to be
*elided* in function signatures.

A *lifetime position* is anywhere you can write a lifetime in a type:

```rust
&'a T
&'a mut T
T<'a>
```

Lifetime positions can appear as either "input" or "output":

* For `fn` definitions, input refers to the types of the formal arguments
  in the `fn` definition, while output refers to
  result types. So `fn foo(s: &str) -> (&str, &str)` has elided one lifetime in
  input position and two lifetimes in output position.
  Note that the input positions of a `fn` method definition do not
  include the lifetimes that occur in the method's `impl` header
  (nor lifetimes that occur in the trait header, for a default method).

* In the future, it should be possible to elide `impl` headers in the same manner.

有3条规则：

* 每一个被省略的函数参数成为一个不同的生命周期参数。
* 如果刚好有一个输入生命周期，不管是否省略，这个生命周期被赋予所有函数返回值中被省略的生命周期。
* 如果有多个输入生命周期，不过它们当中有一个是`&self`或者`&mut self`，`self`的生命周期被赋予所有省略的输出生命周期。

否则，省略一个输出生命周期将是一个错误。

## 例子
这里有一些省略了生命周期的函数的例子。我们用它们的扩展形式配对了每个省略了生命周期的例子。

```rust
fn print(s: &str); // elided
fn print<'a>(s: &'a str); // expanded

fn debug(lvl: u32, s: &str); // elided
fn debug<'a>(lvl: u32, s: &'a str); // expanded

// In the preceding example, `lvl` doesn’t need a lifetime because it’s not a
// reference (`&`). Only things relating to references (such as a `struct`
// which contains a reference) need lifetimes.

fn substr(s: &str, until: u32) -> &str; // elided
fn substr<'a>(s: &'a str, until: u32) -> &'a str; // expanded

fn get_str() -> &str; // ILLEGAL, no inputs

fn frob(s: &str, t: &str) -> &str; // ILLEGAL, two inputs
fn frob<'a, 'b>(s: &'a str, t: &'b str) -> &str; // Expanded: Output lifetime is ambiguous

fn get_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T; // elided
fn get_mut<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut T; // expanded

fn args<T:ToCStr>(&mut self, args: &[T]) -> &mut Command; // elided
fn args<'a, 'b, T:ToCStr>(&'a mut self, args: &'b [T]) -> &'a mut Command; // expanded

fn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> BufWriter; // elided
fn new<'a>(buf: &'a mut [u8]) -> BufWriter<'a>; // expanded
```

### 扩展
Rust enforces these rules through *lifetimes*. Lifetimes are effectively
just names for scopes somewhere in the program. Each reference,
and anything that contains a reference, is tagged with a lifetime specifying
the scope it's valid for.

Within a function body, Rust generally doesn't let you explicitly name the
lifetimes involved. This is because it's generally not really necessary
to talk about lifetimes in a local context; Rust has all the information and
can work out everything as optimally as possible. Many anonymous scopes and
temporaries that you would otherwise have to write are often introduced to
make your code Just Work.

However once you cross the function boundary, you need to start talking about
lifetimes. Lifetimes are denoted with an apostrophe: `'a`, `'static`. To dip
our toes with lifetimes, we're going to pretend that we're actually allowed
to label scopes with lifetimes, and desugar the examples from the start of
this chapter.

Originally, our examples made use of *aggressive* sugar -- high fructose corn
syrup even -- around scopes and lifetimes, because writing everything out
explicitly is *extremely noisy*. All Rust code relies on aggressive inference
and elision of "obvious" things.

One particularly interesting piece of sugar is that each `let` statement implicitly
introduces a scope. For the most part, this doesn't really matter. However it
does matter for variables that refer to each other. As a simple example, let's
completely desugar this simple piece of Rust code:

```rust
let x = 0;
let y = &x;
let z = &y;
```

The borrow checker always tries to minimize the extent of a lifetime, so it will
likely desugar to the following:

```rust
// NOTE: `'a: {` and `&'b x` is not valid syntax!
'a: {
    let x: i32 = 0;
    'b: {
        // lifetime used is 'b because that's good enough.
        let y: &'b i32 = &'b x;
        'c: {
            // ditto on 'c
            let z: &'c &'b i32 = &'c y;
        }
    }
}
```

Wow. That's... awful. Let's all take a moment to thank Rust for making this easier.

Actually passing references to outer scopes will cause Rust to infer
a larger lifetime:

```rust
let x = 0;
let z;
let y = &x;
z = y;
```

```rust
'a: {
    let x: i32 = 0;
    'b: {
        let z: &'b i32;
        'c: {
            // Must use 'b here because this reference is
            // being passed to that scope.
            let y: &'b i32 = &'b x;
            z = y;
        }
    }
}
```



# Example: references that outlive referents

Alright, let's look at some of those examples from before:

```rust
fn as_str(data: &u32) -> &str {
    let s = format!("{}", data);
    &s
}
```

desugars to:

```rust
fn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str {
    'b: {
        let s = format!("{}", data);
        return &'a s;
    }
}
```

This signature of `as_str` takes a reference to a u32 with *some* lifetime, and
promises that it can produce a reference to a str that can live *just as long*.
Already we can see why this signature might be trouble. That basically implies
that we're going to find a str somewhere in the scope the reference
to the u32 originated in, or somewhere *even earlier*. That's a bit of a tall
order.

We then proceed to compute the string `s`, and return a reference to it. Since
the contract of our function says the reference must outlive `'a`, that's the
lifetime we infer for the reference. Unfortunately, `s` was defined in the
scope `'b`, so the only way this is sound is if `'b` contains `'a` -- which is
clearly false since `'a` must contain the function call itself. We have therefore
created a reference whose lifetime outlives its referent, which is *literally*
the first thing we said that references can't do. The compiler rightfully blows
up in our face.

To make this more clear, we can expand the example:

```rust
fn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str {
    'b: {
        let s = format!("{}", data);
        return &'a s
    }
}

fn main() {
    'c: {
        let x: u32 = 0;
        'd: {
            // An anonymous scope is introduced because the borrow does not
            // need to last for the whole scope x is valid for. The return
            // of as_str must find a str somewhere before this function
            // call. Obviously not happening.
            println!("{}", as_str::<'d>(&'d x));
        }
    }
}
```

Shoot!

Of course, the right way to write this function is as follows:

```rust
fn to_string(data: &u32) -> String {
    format!("{}", data)
}
```

We must produce an owned value inside the function to return it! The only way
we could have returned an `&'a str` would have been if it was in a field of the
`&'a u32`, which is obviously not the case.

(Actually we could have also just returned a string literal, which as a global
can be considered to reside at the bottom of the stack; though this limits
our implementation *just a bit*.)





### Example: aliasing a mutable reference

How about the other example:

```rust
let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = &data[0];
data.push(4);
println!("{}", x);
```

```rust
'a: {
    let mut data: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
    'b: {
        // 'b is as big as we need this borrow to be
        // (just need to get to `println!`)
        let x: &'b i32 = Index::index::<'b>(&'b data, 0);
        'c: {
            // Temporary scope because we don't need the
            // &mut to last any longer.
            Vec::push(&'c mut data, 4);
        }
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
```

The problem here is a bit more subtle and interesting. We want Rust to
reject this program for the following reason: We have a live shared reference `x`
to a descendant of `data` when we try to take a mutable reference to `data`
to `push`. This would create an aliased mutable reference, which would
violate the *second* rule of references.

However this is *not at all* how Rust reasons that this program is bad. Rust
doesn't understand that `x` is a reference to a subpath of `data`. It doesn't
understand Vec at all. What it *does* see is that `x` has to live for `'b` to
be printed. The signature of `Index::index` subsequently demands that the
reference we take to `data` has to survive for `'b`. When we try to call `push`,
it then sees us try to make an `&'c mut data`. Rust knows that `'c` is contained
within `'b`, and rejects our program because the `&'b data` must still be live!

Here we see that the lifetime system is much more coarse than the reference
semantics we're actually interested in preserving. For the most part, *that's
totally ok*, because it keeps us from spending all day explaining our program
to the compiler. However it does mean that several programs that are totally
correct with respect to Rust's *true* semantics are rejected because lifetimes
are too dumb.

### Limits of Lifetimes

Given the following code:

```rust
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn mutate_and_share(&mut self) -> &Self { &*self }
    fn share(&self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let mut foo = Foo;
    let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();
    foo.share();
}
```

One might expect it to compile. We call `mutate_and_share`, which mutably borrows
`foo` temporarily, but then returns only a shared reference. Therefore we
would expect `foo.share()` to succeed as `foo` shouldn't be mutably borrowed.

However when we try to compile it:

```text
<anon>:11:5: 11:8 error: cannot borrow `foo` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
<anon>:11     foo.share();
              ^~~
<anon>:10:16: 10:19 note: previous borrow of `foo` occurs here; the mutable borrow prevents subsequent moves, borrows, or modification of `foo` until the borrow ends
<anon>:10     let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();
                         ^~~
<anon>:12:2: 12:2 note: previous borrow ends here
<anon>:8 fn main() {
<anon>:9     let mut foo = Foo;
<anon>:10     let loan = foo.mutate_and_share();
<anon>:11     foo.share();
<anon>:12 }
          ^
```

What happened? Well, we got the exact same reasoning as we did for
[Example 2 in the previous section][ex2]. We desugar the program and we get
the following:

```rust
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn mutate_and_share<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a Self { &'a *self }
    fn share<'a>(&'a self) {}
}

fn main() {
	'b: {
    	let mut foo: Foo = Foo;
    	'c: {
    		let loan: &'c Foo = Foo::mutate_and_share::<'c>(&'c mut foo);
    		'd: {
    			Foo::share::<'d>(&'d foo);
    		}
    	}
    }
}
```

The lifetime system is forced to extend the `&mut foo` to have lifetime `'c`,
due to the lifetime of `loan` and mutate_and_share's signature. Then when we
try to call `share`, and it sees we're trying to alias that `&'c mut foo` and
blows up in our face!

This program is clearly correct according to the reference semantics we actually
care about, but the lifetime system is too coarse-grained to handle that.

### Unbounded Lifetimes

Unsafe code can often end up producing references or lifetimes out of thin air.
Such lifetimes come into the world as *unbounded*. The most common source of this
is dereferencing a raw pointer, which produces a reference with an unbounded lifetime.
Such a lifetime becomes as big as context demands. This is in fact more powerful
than simply becoming `'static`, because for instance `&'static &'a T`
will fail to typecheck, but the unbound lifetime will perfectly mold into
`&'a &'a T` as needed. However for most intents and purposes, such an unbounded
lifetime can be regarded as `'static`.

Almost no reference is `'static`, so this is probably wrong. `transmute` and
`transmute_copy` are the two other primary offenders. One should endeavor to
bound an unbounded lifetime as quick as possible, especially across function
boundaries.

Given a function, any output lifetimes that don't derive from inputs are
unbounded. For instance:

```rust
fn get_str<'a>() -> &'a str;
```

will produce an `&str` with an unbounded lifetime. The easiest way to avoid
unbounded lifetimes is to use lifetime elision at the function boundary.
If an output lifetime is elided, then it *must* be bounded by an input lifetime.
Of course it might be bounded by the *wrong* lifetime, but this will usually
just cause a compiler error, rather than allow memory safety to be trivially
violated.

Within a function, bounding lifetimes is more error-prone. The safest and easiest
way to bound a lifetime is to return it from a function with a bound lifetime.
However if this is unacceptable, the reference can be placed in a location with
a specific lifetime. Unfortunately it's impossible to name all lifetimes involved
in a function.
